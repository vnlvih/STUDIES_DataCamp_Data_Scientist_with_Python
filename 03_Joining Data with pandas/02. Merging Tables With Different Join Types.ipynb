In this exercise, you will practice this by creating a table that for each movie will list the movie director and a member of the crew on one row. You have been given a table called crews, which has columns id, job, and name. First, merge the table to itself using the movie ID. This merge will give you a larger table where for each movie, every job is matched against each other. Then select only those rows with a director in the left table, and avoid having a row where the director's job is listed in both the left and right tables. This filtering will remove job combinations that aren't with the director."],"metadata":{"id":"MuaNpbDFiCer"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["crews = pd.read_pickle(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/Data Science & Afins/DATACAMP/01.
